# ErnGearRandomizer

This is a Morrowind [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/) NPC gear randomizer. It randomly swaps out clothing, weapons, and armor on Morrowind NPCs.

This has *no dependencies* on any other mods and will *work with all content*, whether provided by a mod or with the base game.

Every playthrough will result in different gear for NPCs.

Even though there are safeties in place to not break Vanilla or Expansion quests, it's possible that quests might be harder or broken. Quests provided by mods are susceptible to breaking more.
